## Election-Audit Summary
This election-audit script can be used to analyze any election in the future and will be a great value for the election commision. 
To use the script, the data on the election_results.csv should be replaced with the new elections data and we will obtain the same outputs.
The election-audit script can be further modified to show the breakdown of the number and percentage of votes each candidate received for the different counties. 
Similary, We can also see the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county for each candidate.
